# JUSTtheTalk - API

This is the API component of the JUSTtheTalk Discussion Forum. It is written using Go/GorillaMux/GORM

## Project Status

The project is incomplete and still under active development prior to the first production release however a beta version is running on https://beta.justthetalk.com. While mostly feature complete the project requires a some of refactoring and polish.

There are still some design decisions to be finalised. Some objects are currently cached in Redis, I'm not sure there is much benefit to this at the moment. I might rip it out.

Test coverage needs to be improved.
